8086 Assembly level programs 

** WE DO NOT TAKE INPUT IN ANY OF THE PROGRAMS BUT HARDCODE THEM IN THE .DATA SECTIONN OF OUR PROGRAM

1.8086 ALP to check whether the given number is prime or not .
      Now for this program we are NOT taking any input  

2. 8086 ALP to count the number of words in the given string.
3. 8086 ALP to toggle the case of characters in the given string. 
      If the case is capital then the ascii value would lie below 97 and we will add 32 to the this value 
      to make it small.
      
      Similarly if the ascii value is more than or equal to 97 then it is small and we will sub 32 to this value
      to make it capital. 
      
4.8086 ALP to print all the elements of an array.

5. 8086 ALP  to find and print the largest element from the given array 

6. 8086 ALP  to find all the prime numbers within a range. It only prints the numbers that are prime and NOT their 
      indices.
